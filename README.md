# Bookshelf Rearranger

This project aims to rearrange books on your bookshelf by the years they were published or thought to have been written. You can upload an image of your bookshelf, and the application will extract the book names, verify them via a book data API, and prompt you for manual input if necessary. It will then print a list of rearranged books.
